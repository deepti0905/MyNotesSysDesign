# Database Comparisions

## SQL
### MySQL

* Easy to use
* It is secure
  * MySQL consists of a solid data security layer that protects sensitive data from intruders. Also, passwords are encrypted in MySQL.
* Client/ Server Architecture
* It is scalable
  * MySQL supports multi-threading that makes it easily scalable. It can handle almost any amount of data, up to as much as 50 million rows or more. The default file size limit is about 4 GB. However, we can increase this number to a theoretical limit of 8 TB of data.

* Speed
MySQL is considered one of the very fast database languages, backed by a large number of the benchmark test.

* Allows roll-back

MySQL allows transactions to be rolled back, commit, and crash recovery.

* Memory efficiency

Its efficiency is high because it has a very low memory leakage problem.

* High Performance

MySQL is faster, more reliable, and cheaper because of its unique storage engine architecture. It provides very high-performance results in comparison to other databases without losing an essential functionality of the software. It has fast loading utilities because of the different cache memory.

* High Productivity

MySQL uses Triggers, Stored procedures, and views that allow the developer to give higher productivity.

* Partitioning

This feature improves the performance and provides fast management of the large database.

Disadvantages/Drawback of MySQL
Following are the few disadvantages of MySQL:

* MySQL version less than 5.0 doesn't support ROLE, COMMIT, and stored procedure.
* MySQL does not support a very large database size as efficiently.
* MySQL doesn't handle transactions very efficiently, and it is prone to data corruption.
* MySQL is accused that it doesn't have a good developing and debugging tool compared to paid databases.
* MySQL doesn't support SQL check constraints.
